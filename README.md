# Learning 👀 

**The process of learning anything.**

1. First define space(Input): Space is a collection of tiny elements of a particular domain. It might be the space of letters/words for language, numbers/objects for mathematics, atoms/subatomic particles(e,p,n)/Composite particles(quark, leptons, gauge bosons, higgs hosons) for physics, ions/chemical elements, for chemistry,..., and arrays/matrics/tensors for computer science. Each element of space has its own meaning.
2. Second define a relationship: predicate,function(process),probability function: pmf,pdf between space elements: which takes space elements from space and does something meaningful operation. Grammer(s+v+o) is for language, mathematical operations(+,-,/,...) for mathematics,..., CRUD operation for computer science.
3. Third, we receive output from operation(Output): which has a beautiful meaning.

Note: A predicate is a type of relation. A relation is a particular type of set. A function is a particular type of relation. Every machine learning is condition probability function(p(class/data point))

**Why the process of learning anything is call life long?**

Because we continiously collect tiny elements(data) for our space(brain). And define relationship between these elements(Brain(model) training).To obtain perfect output.

## Foundations and philosophy

### Mathematical logics

^(and), v (or), ¬ (not), → (implies)...

- predicate: A predicate is a statement or mathematical assertion that contains variables, sometimes referred to as predicate variables, and may be true or false depending on those variables' value or values.

  Like function in algebra $f(a)$ which take input a and process it for output. 

  In mathematical logic: $P(a)$, the symbol ${\displaystyle P}$ is a predicate which applies to the individual constant ${\displaystyle a}$. Similarly, in the formula ${\displaystyle R(a,b)}$, ${\displaystyle R}$ is a predicate which applies to the individual constants ${\displaystyle a}$ and ${\displaystyle b}$.

- Mathematical logic is the study of formal logic within mathematics. 
- Mathematical logic is massively use in computer science e.g in boolean data type and may more.

If E is a logical predicate, $\neg E$ is the predicate that evaluates to true if and only if E evaluates to false. For clarity, it is often replaced by the word "not". In programming languages and some mathematical texts, it is sometimes replaced by **"~" or "!"**, which are easier to type on some keyboards.
		- [X] [Logical conjunction, logical and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction): Denotes the logical and, and is read as "and". If E and F are logical predicates, ${\displaystyle E\land F}$ is true if E and F are both true. It is often replaced by the word "and" or the symbol "&".
		- [X] [Logical disjunction, logical or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction): Denotes the logical or, and is read as "or". If E and F are logical predicates, ${\displaystyle E\lor F}$ is true if either E, F, or both are true. It is often replaced by the word "or".
		- [X] [Exclusive or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or): if E and F are two Boolean variables or predicates, ${\displaystyle E\veebar F}$ denotes the exclusive or. Notations E XOR F and ${\displaystyle E\oplus F}$ are also commonly used; see ⊕.
		- [X] [Implication (logic)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implication_(logic)): Implication (also known as logical consequence, implies, or If ... then) is a logical operation. It is the relationship between statements that holds true when one logically "follows from" one or more others. While a statement of the form "if P then Q" is often written as ${\displaystyle P\to Q}$, the assertion that "Q is a logical consequence P" is often written as ${\displaystyle P\implies Q}$.
		- [X] [material conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional): Denotes material conditional, and is read as "implies". If P and Q are logical predicates, ${\displaystyle P\Rightarrow Q}$  means that if P is true, then Q is also true. Thus, ${\displaystyle P\Rightarrow Q}$ is logically equivalent with ${\displaystyle Q\lor \neg P}$.
		- [X] [Logical biconditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_biconditional)

			- [X] [Existential quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification): Denotes existential quantification and is read "there exists ... such that". If E is a logical predicate, ${\displaystyle \exists xE}$ means that there exists at least one value of x for which E is true.

			- [X] [uniqueness quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_quantification): Denotes uniqueness quantification, that is, ${\displaystyle \exists !xP}$ means "there exists exactly one x such that P (is true)". In other words, ${\displaystyle \exists !xP(x)}$ is an abbreviation of ${\displaystyle \exists x\,(P(x)\,\wedge \neg \exists y\,(P(y)\wedge y\neq x))}\exists x\,( P(x) \, \wedge \neg \exists y\,(P(y) \wedge y  \ne x))$.

### Set theory

$Name of the set(Capital Italic) = \{element1, element2...\}$

Example: $A = \{a,b,c..\}$

- Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects. Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.

**Basic concepts and notation**
- [X] [Set (mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)): A set is the mathematical model for a collection of different things; a set contains elements or members, which can be mathematical objects of any kind: **numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets**.


- [X] [Naive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory): Naive set theory is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics. Unlike axiomatic set theories, which are defined using formal logic, naive set theory is defined informally, in natural language.

    - [X] [Russell's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox): 
	- [X] [Axiomatic theories: Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/ZF.html): Aims to navigate the paradoxes of naive set theory by providing a rigorous defination of what a set is.
	

- [X] [How sets are defined and set notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#How_sets_are_defined_and_set_notation): Mathematical texts commonly denote sets by capital letters in italic, such as A, B, C. A set may also be called a collection or family, especially when its elements are themselves sets.
    - [X] [Roster notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Roster_notation):Roster or enumeration notation defines a set by listing its elements between curly brackets, separated by commas:A = {4, 2, 1, 3},B = {blue, white, red}.Infinite sets in roster notation: {..., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
	- [X] [Semantic definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Semantic_definition): Another way to define a set is to use a rule to determine what the elements are:Let A be the set whose members are the first four positive integers.Let B be the set of colors of the French flag.Such a definition is called a semantic description.
	- [X] [Set-builder notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation): Set-builder notation specifies a set as a selection from a larger set, determined by a condition on the elements.For example, a set F can be defined as follows: ${\displaystyle F=\{n\mid n{\text{ is an integer, and }}0\leq n\leq 19\}}$. 
	
	${\displaystyle \{x\in E\mid \Phi (x)\},}$ or by adjoining it to the predicate: ${\displaystyle \{x\mid x\in E{\text{ and }}\Phi (x)\}\quad {\text{or}}\quad \{x\mid x\in E\land \Phi (x)\}.}$

- [X] [Membership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(mathematics)): If B is a set and x is an element of B, this is written in shorthand as x ∈ B, which can also be read as "x belongs to B", or "x is in B". The statement "y is not an element of B" is written as y ∉ B, which can also be read as "y is not in B".
- [X] [Universal set(U)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_set): In set theory, a universal set is a set which contains all objects, including itself.
- [X] [The empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set): The empty set (or null set) is the unique set that has no members. 

It is denoted ∅ or ${\displaystyle \emptyset }\emptyset$  or { } or ϕ (or ϕ).

- [X] [Singleton sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(mathematics)): A singleton set is a set with exactly one element; such a set may also be called a unit set. Any such set can be written as {x}, where x is the element. The set {x} and the element x mean different things; Halmos draws the analogy that a box containing a hat is not the same as the hat.
- [X] [Subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset): If every element of set A is also in B, then A is described as being a subset of B, or contained in B, written A ⊆ B, or B ⊇ A. The latter notation may be read B contains A, B includes A, or B is a superset of A. The relationship between sets established by ⊆ is called inclusion or containment. Two sets are equal if they contain each other: A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A is equivalent to A = B.
    - [X] [Proper subset](https://web.archive.org/web/20130123202559/http://it.edgecombe.edu/homepage/killorant/MAT140/Module1/Subsets.pdf): if A ⊆ B and A ≠ B then we say that A is a Proper Subset of B. (every element of A is in B but they are not
equal)
- [X] [Euler and Venn diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Euler_and_Venn_diagrams): An Euler diagram is a graphical representation of a collection of sets; each set is depicted as a planar region enclosed by a loop, with its elements inside. 
- [X] [Special sets of numbers in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Special_sets_of_numbers_in_mathematics)
    - [X] ${\displaystyle \mathbf {N} }$ or ${\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }$, the set of all natural numbers: ${\displaystyle \mathbf {N} =\{0,1,2,3,...\}}$ (often, authors exclude 0)
	- [X] ${\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} }$ or ${\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }$ , the set of all integers (whether positive, negative or zero): ${\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} =\{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\}}$
	- [X] ${\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} }$ or ${\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }$ , the set of all rational numbers (that is, the set of all proper and improper fractions).
	- [X] ${\displaystyle \mathbf {R} }$ or ${\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }$ , the set of all real numbers, including all rational numbers and all irrational numbers (which include algebraic numbers such as ${\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}$ that cannot be rewritten as fractions, as well as transcendental numbers such as π and e)
	- [X] ${\displaystyle \mathbf {C} }$ or ${\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }$, the set of all complex numbers: C = {a + bi | a, b ∈ R}, for example, 1 + 2i ∈ C.
	

- [X] [Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)): A function (or mapping) from a set A to a set B is a rule that assigns to each "input" element of A an "output" that is an element of B; more formally, a function is a special kind of relation, one that relates each element of A to exactly one element of B. A function is called
    - [X] injective (or one-to-one) if it maps any two different elements of A to different elements of B,
	- [X] surjective (or onto) if for every element of B, there is at least one element of A that maps to it, and
    - [X] bijective (or a one-to-one correspondence) if the function is both injective and surjective — in this case, each element of A is paired with a unique element of B, and each element of B is paired with a unique element of A, so that there are no unpaired elements.

- [X] [Cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality): The cardinality of a set S, denoted ${\displaystyle \#{}S}$ or |S|, is the number of members of S. For example, if B = {blue, white, red}, then |B| = 3. Repeated members in roster notation are not counted,so |{blue, white, red, blue, white}| = 3, too.More formally, two sets share the same cardinality if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between them.The cardinality of the empty set is zero.
- [X] [Power sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set): The power set of a set S is the set of all subsets of S. The empty set and S itself are elements of the power set of S, because these are both subsets of S. For example, the power set of {1, 2, 3} is {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}. The power set of a set S is commonly written as P(S) or 2S.
- [X] [Partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set): A partition of a set S is a set of nonempty subsets of S, such that every element x in S is in exactly one of these subsets.That is, the subsets are pairwise disjoint (meaning any two sets of the partition contain no element in common), and the union of all the subsets of the partition is S.

### Category theory

f:x→y,f:y→z,g o f:x→z , functors(functions) map between categories ...

- A category is formed by two sorts of objects, the objects of the category, and the morphisms, which relate two objects called the source and the target of the morphism.

- It becomes a ground for unification of interdisciplinary mathematical ideas; and the way it achieves this is by taking an abstract vantage point on objects, relationships, states, events, processes, and trajectories of these disciplines.

- Category theory use to analyze deep learning model, input(source object), label(target object) and model is known as functors.

    - Limit :  Limit of function f(x) at x->a, means value of function f(x) when we approaching x to a from both side or one side.
	- Note: If No sign +,- then we need to do analysis from both side
	- Both side: Analyze from both side and approach near if the limit from both side is nearly same then that is answer. Otherwise unbounded/ doesn't exist
	- One Side: Analyze from only one side
	- Try to remove divisible term, which try to generate Indeterminate form(0/0)

    - Derivative: Derivative of function f(x) at x = a is define as solpe of tangent for this function at a. i.e from right side: (f(x+h)-f(x))/(x + h - x)= p/b = $tan\theta$ or from left side: (f(x-h)-f(x))/(x - h - x) = p/b = $tan\theta$. Analysis from both side.
    - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $f'(x)$ are representation of derivative. In actual we do  (f(x+h)-f(x))/(x + h -x) while doing derivative in computer science. But this representation help to analyze complex structure.


	Univeriate Calculus

    - [X] [Average vs. instantaneous rate of change](https://calcworkshop.com/derivatives/average-rate-of-change-calculus/): While both are used to find the slope, the average rate of change calculates the slope of the secant line(f(b)-f(a))/(b-a) using the slope formula from algebra. The instantaneous rate(f(x+h)-f(x))/(x + h - x) (where h is very small change) of change calculates the slope of the tangent line using derivatives.

- [X] [Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral)
    
	- Integral : In 2D: ${\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx.}$ , f(x) is the function with y-axis and dx is in x-axis and multiplication of length and width gives us area from a to b. Similiar in 3D we calculate volume.
	- In mathematics, an integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that describes displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data.
	- Integration notation ${\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx.}$ is only for solving complex notation. Later inegral can be express in term of summation later to do integration in computer science. 
	- So we must need to focus on what actually function(f(x)) is and in which function depend(x).

## Applied Mathematics

### Probability

- First we need to create a space.
- Calculate Probability/probability distributation from space 
- [ ] [Probability for Computer Scientists: Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/)

- Probability calculation steps 

	- Specify the sam pie space
	- Specify a probability law
	- Identify an event of interest
	- Calculate ... 

- [X] [Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory)): In probability theory, an event is a set of outcomes of an experiment (a subset of the sample space) to which a probability is assigned.

- [X] [Independent events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)): (If two events, A and B are independent then the joint probability is: ${\displaystyle P(A{\mbox{ and }}B)=P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B).}$. For example, if two coins are flipped, then the chance of both being heads is ${\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}={\tfrac {1}{4}}}{\tfrac {1}{2}}\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}={\tfrac {1}{4}}$).

- [X] [Mutually exclusive events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusivity): If either event A or event B can occur but never both simultaneously, then they are called mutually exclusive events.A clear example is the set of outcomes of a single coin toss, which can result in either heads or tails, but not both.


- [X] [Not mutually exclusive events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#Not_mutually_exclusive_events): 

- [X] [Collectively exhaustive events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectively_exhaustive_events): In probability theory and logic, a set of events is jointly or collectively exhaustive if at least one of the events must occur. For example, when rolling a six-sided die, the events 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 balls of a single outcome are collectively exhaustive, because they encompass the entire range of possible outcomes.

- [X] [Sample space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space): In probability theory, the sample space (also called sample description space or possibility space) of an experiment or random trial is the set of all possible outcomes or results of that experiment.

In x-axis we have events and in y-axis we have p.d.f(which value is not in 0-1 becaus it is not probability)
- [X] [Joint probability distributatio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointprobability.asp): Probability of multiple events occurring simultaneously. two random variables that are defined on the same probability space, the joint probability distribution is the corresponding probability distribution on all possible pairs of outputs.
- [X] [Marginal Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution): It's like normal probability in join probability curve. It may be thought of as an unconditional probability. It is not conditioned on another event.

### Statistics

- Statistics (from German: Statistik, orig. "description of a state, a country") is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
- Descriptive statistics: Space is data calculate mean,variance,distributation.. from data
- Inferential statistics: Inference data from mean,variance,distributation...



####  Descriptive statistics

A descriptive statistic (in the count noun sense) is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features from a collection of information, while descriptive statistics (in the mass noun sense) is the process of using and analysing those statistics.

#### Inferential statistics

Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying distribution of probability. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.

Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population. In machine learning, the term inference is sometimes used instead to mean "make a prediction, by evaluating an already trained model"; in this context inferring properties of the model is referred to as training or learning (rather than inference), and using a model for prediction is referred to as inference (instead of prediction); see also predictive inference.

### Python

Python is object. Everything is object in python. Strings are objects, Lists are objects, Functions are objects and Even modules are also objects.

Python is using a pure object model where classes are instances of a meta-class “type” in Python, the terms “type” and “class” are synonyms. And “type” is the only class which is an instance of itself.

Except for the Python keywords like “if def, globals”, using type(<name>) or dir(<name>) or just type the resource name and press enter- will work on pretty much anything.

### Natural Language Processing

[NLP problems and datasets](https://github.com/MadanBaduwal/NLP-problems-and-datasets)

#### Introduction,tools and some basic components

**Corpus(files):** Large collection of text documents,such as books, news articles, etc. "corpora" = plural form of corpus

* Corpus is  a large collection of texts used for studying language. A corpus is usually annotated (=word are labelled with information about the part of speech and grammatical category). The terms corpus and text corpus and language corpus are interchangeable. Using a corpus for any type of linguistic or language oriented work ensures the outcomes reflect the real use of the language.


**Lexicon(शब्दकोश)(data in data structure):** A lexicon is a collection of words. It is like a dictionary(list of vocabulary). Each word may have additional information like part of speech (noun, verb, etc.) and the meaning/definition.

Corpus diyako x vanyasi .txt file deko x vanni bujni. And lexicon diyako x vanyasi collection of words diyako x vanni bujni.

**Dictionary(data in data structure)** : Collection of words.

Example : Dictionary : 
  {'This': 0, 'first': 1, 'is': 2, 'line': 3, 'These': 4, 'are': 5, 'lines': 6, 'second': 7, 'third': 8}


**Tokenization(process):** Tokenization is the process of breaking corpus into sentences or sentence and phrase into smaller units called tokens(words).
    * Word Tokenization
	* Sentence Tokenization

**Frequency distribution :** We can explore the frequence distribution of words.


**Encoding :** Unicode is a string character that we see. However, disk text is stored in an encoded form. Few popular encodings are UTF-8, ASCII, Latin-2.


**Linguistic :** The scientific study of language is known as linguistics.

**Phoenetics and Phonology :** Phoenitics and Phonology is the study of knowledge on linguistic sounds.

**Morphology :** Morphology is the study of structure and formation of words from smaller units called morphemes.
   * the study of the forms of things.
   * a particular form, shape, or structur
   * English mainly uses prefixes and suffixes to express inflectional and derivational morphology. 

   * Example : cat-cats,walk-walks,computerize-computerization...

**Syntax :** Syntax deals with the knowledge of structural relationship between words.

**Semantics :** Semantics deals with the knowledge of meaning of words that makeup a phrase or a sentence. Relating to meaning in language or logic.


**Pragmatics(paragraph) :** Pragmatics deals with the study of relationship between the meaning of the word / phrases / sentences inrelation to the intention of the speaker.

**Discourse(प्रवचन) :** written or spoken communication or debate.

**Pragmatics Vs Discourse:** Pragmatics deals with the context of a sentence and determines its meaning referencing that aprticular context where as discourse refers to understanding the language in actual communication with larger units like paragraphs.


**What are some of the lower level components?**
- **Tokenization**: breaking text into tokens (words, sentences, n-grams)
- **Stopword removal**: a/an/the
- **Stemming and lemmatization**: root word
- **TF-IDF**: word importance
- **Part-of-speech tagging**: noun/verb/adjective
- **Named entity recognition**: person/organization/location
- **Spelling correction**: "New Yrok City"
- **Word sense disambiguation**:identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence. eg: "buy a mouse"
- **Segmentation**: Text segmentation is the process of dividing written text into meaningful units, such as words, sentences, or topics. eg : "New York City subway"
- **Language detection**: "translate this page"
- **Machine learning**

Why is NLP hard?

** __Ambiguity__**

Human language is highly ambiguous instead of computer language(programming language), which is not vague by design. 


 Let's discuss different types of ambiguity that occur in language.

$\textbf{1. Phonological ambiguity:}$


Phonological ambiguity can be described as words that sound similar(same) but are different in meaning. Such ambiguity arises on a dialogue-based system.

For example,

  - __I__ vs. __Eye__
  - __No__ vs. __Know__
  - __Peace__ vs. __Piece__

$\textbf{2. Lexical ambiguity:}$  
A lexeme is a smallest or basic unit of the lexicon in language that bears some meaning. A lexicon is a list of all words(vocabulary) used in a particular language or dictionary. 

Lexical ambiguity can be described as words that have identical form but have unrelated or distinct meanings. 


For example,

   - __bank__ - commercial bank vs. river bank
   - __mean__ - mathematical average vs. not nice


$\textbf{3. Syntactic  ambiguity:}$  

Syntax refers to the structural relationship between words.

In syntactic ambiguity, ambiguity arises not due to the presence of lexeme with several meanings, but because the sentence's syntactic structure causes multiple interpretations. It is also called structural ambiguity.

For example,

$$\textbf{The tourist saw the child with telescope}$$

There is two possible interpretation of the sentence:
   1. The tourist has a telescope, and he saw a child when watching through it.
   2. A child has a telescope, and the tourist saw him.


$\textbf{4. Semantic ambiguity:}$  

Semantics refers to the meaning of the words that make up a phrase or a sentence.

Even after the syntax and the meaning of the individual words have been resolved, there is still ambiguity in the sentence, which is demonstrated with the following example.

$$\textbf{Mark and Elizabeth got married last week.}$$

The ambiguity here is that if Mark and Elizabeth got married to each other or a different person.

$\textbf{5. Pragmatic ambiguity:}$  

Pragmatics refers to studying the relationship between the meaning of the word/phrases/sentences concerning the speaker's intention.

Sometimes, the whole context is needed to understand the meaning of individual sentences. For example,

$$\textbf{I love chicken.}$$

The above sentence can be interpreted in two ways based on two different contexts. First, if the person talks about the food they like, then chicken refers to the meat. Second, if people are animals they want, then chicken refers to the chicken as an animal.

- **Non-standard English**: tweets/text messages
- **Idioms**: "throw in the towel"
- **Newly coined words**: "retweet"
- **Tricky entity names**: "Where is A Bug's Life playing?"
- **World knowledge**: "Mary and Sue are sisters", "Mary and Sue are mothers"


**__How to avoid these ambiguities?__**

To avoid these ambiguities, we need an understanding of the world or context in which different words or the sentence as a whole are used. 

For example, the word "bank" appears in two different contexts, and if we are familiar with the context, this ambiguity is not a problem.

Similarly, in the sentence, "When a hammer hits the glass table, it shattered,". If we have the common sense that that hammer is made from metal and is unlikely to shatter, an ambiguous referal of the word "it" is no longer a problem.


Moreover, we will need to perform the different analysis levels like morphological analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, pragmatic analysis, etc. to avoid ambiguities. We will discuss these in upcoming chapters.

## Paper Writing

- [X] [How to write a good CVPR submission - William T. Freeman](https://billf.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/cvprPapers.pdf)

    - [X] [1](): The most dangerous mistake you can make when writing your paper is assuming that the reviewer will understand the point of your paper. The complaint is often heard that the reviewer did not understand what an author was trying to say
	    * Make it easy to see the main point

    - [X] [1](): Start by stating which problem you are addressing, keeping the **audience in mind**. They must care about it, which means that sometimes you must tell them **why they should care about the problem**.**why the problem is interesting**.
	- [X] [2](): Then state briefly what the **other solutions are to the problem**, and why they aren't satisfactory. If they were satisfactory, you wouldn't need to do the work. **How your paper differs (and improves upon) previous work**.**what problem it solves**.**What is really new in your paper (and what isn't)**
	- [X] [3](): Then explain your own solution, compare it with other solutions, and say why it's better. 
	- [X] [4](): At the end, talk about related work where similar techniques and experiments have been used, but applied to a different problem.

**Approach of solving any type of problem**

1. First define space(Input)
2. Second define a function(Process)
3. Third, we receive output from operation(Output)

**Universl Rules**
* Everything is start from left to right

    Examples:

	* In computer science everything start from left-top corner 
	* Clock wise direction is left to right
	* Writing in paper is start from left-top to right.

**Result of learning?**

Find out the problem in existing system. Try to fix it with new approach.
